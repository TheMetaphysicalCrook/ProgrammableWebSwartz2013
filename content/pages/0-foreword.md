# Foreword by James Hendler

In 2009, I invited Aaron Swartz to contribute a “synthesis lecture” — essentially
a short online book — to a new series I was editing on Web Engineering. Aaron
produced a draft of about 40 pages, which is the document you see here. This was
a “first version” to be extended later. Unfortunately, and much to my regret, that
never happened.

The version produced by Aaron was not intended to be the finished product.
He wrote this relatively quickly, and sent it to us for comments. I sent him a short
set, and later Frank van Harmelen, who had joined as a coeditor of the series, sent
a longer set. Aaron iterated with us for a bit, but then went on to other things and
hadn’t managed to finish.

With Aaron’s death in January, 2013, we decided it would be good to publish
this so people could read, in his own words, his ideas about programming the Web,
his ambivalence about different aspects of the Semantic Web technology, some
thoughts on Openness, etc.

This document was originally produced in “markdown” format, a simplified
HTML/Wiki format that Aaron co-designed with John Gruber ca. 2004. We used
one of the many free markdown tools available on the Web to turn it into HTML,
and then in turn went from there to Latex to PDF, to produce this document.
This version was also edited to fix various copyediting errors to improve readability.
An HTML version of the original is available at 
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/ProgrammableWebSwartz2009.html.

As a tribute to Aaron, Michael Morgan of Morgan & Claypool, the publisher
of the series,and I have decided to publish it publicly at no cost.
